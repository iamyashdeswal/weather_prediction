        <h1>Weather Prediction</h1>
        <p>Weather prediction, also known as weather forecasting, is the process of using scientific principles and data to make predictions about the future state of the atmosphere. Process - Meteorologists and weather experts analyse various factors such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind patterns, and historical weather data to forecast what the weather will be like in a specific location and time in the future. Advanced technology, like computer models and satellite imagery, plays a significant role in improving the accuracy of weather predictions.</p>

        <h2>The Process of Weather Prediction</h2>
        <p>Weather prediction involves several steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Data Collection: Meteorologists collect data from various sources, including satellites, weather stations, and weather balloons.</li>
            <li>Data Analysis: Collected data is analyzed to understand current weather conditions and trends.</li>
            <li>Numerical Modeling: Computer models are used to simulate the atmosphere and predict future weather based on current conditions.</li>
            <li>Forecasting: Meteorologists make predictions based on model outputs and their expertise.</li>
            <li>Communication: Weather forecasts are communicated to the public through various media.</li>
        </ol>
